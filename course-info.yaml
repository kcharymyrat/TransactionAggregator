summary: "<p>Backend services often depends on other services to receive necessary\
  \ data. In this project, you will design and implement a Transaction Aggregator\
  \ system that demonstrates the fundamentals of inter-service communication using\
  \ REST APIs. The project will also introduce you to the complexities of dealing\
  \ with remote server errors, teaching you to build robust systems that can handle\
  \ unexpected issues gracefully. You will learn how to implement retries to ensure\
  \ system resilience and continuity of service even when remote servers are temporarily\
  \ unavailable.\_Additionally, you'll gain experience in applying caching to optimize\
  \ system performance and efficiency.</p><br/><br/>Learn more at <a href=\"https://hyperskill.org/projects/424?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide&utm_campaign=ide&utm_content=project-card\"\
